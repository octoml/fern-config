All endpoints require authentication by default. That means you will need an access token in order to run inferences against those endpoints. To generate a token, head to your [Account Settings](https://octoai.cloud/settings) and click **Generate token**:

After generating a token, make sure to store it in your terminal and/or environment file for your app.

```bash bash
export OCTOAI_TOKEN=<INSERT_HERE>
```

Now you'll be able to run inferences! For example:

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://text.octoai.run/v1/chat/completions" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OCTOAI_TOKEN" \
    --data-raw '{
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Hello world"
            }
        ],
        "model": "mixtral-8x7b-instruct",
        "max_tokens": 512,
        "presence_penalty": 0,
        "temperature": 0.1,
        "top_p": 0.9
    }'
```
