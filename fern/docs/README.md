# OctoAI Documentation üêô

This is the source of the OctoAI's public facing documentation found at [octo.ai/docs](https://octo.ai/docs). These docs utilize `.mdx` files with the [Fern](https://buildwithfern.com/#docs) service/framework.

## Run Locally üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

**NOTE:** `node` is required for local development of these docs, if you do not have `node` on your system refer to the [NodeJS documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).

Clone the project using

```bash
# via URL
git clone https://github.com/octoml/fern-config.git

# via SSH
git clone git@github.com:octoml/fern-config.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd fern-config/fern/docs
```

Globally install the Fern CLI

```bash
npm i -g fern-api
```

Start the server

```bash
fern generate --docs --preview
```

## Development

It is highly recommended to use the [MDX VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) if using the VSCode IDE.

The `docs.yml` file is the core configuration file where you can specify various settings and properties to customize your documentation. These settings include structure, API configurations, integrations, analytics, redirects, and search engine optimization.

For writing content, the [Fern Docs](https://docs.buildwithfern.com/generate-docs/overview/writing-content) break down the MDX standards required.

There are also Components provided by Fern that can be used to add interactivity and styling to the docs. Those can be found [here](https://docs.buildwithfern.com/generate-docs/component-library/cards).

### OpenAPI

OpenAPI documentation is autogenerated from the parsed OpenAPI spec. See [Fern Docs](https://docs.buildwithfern.com/generate-docs/overview/fern-docs-quickstart#step-5-optional-use-an-openapi-specification) for details.

All OpenAPI specs are in the `./fern/apis` directory.

The docs generated by the specs are held in the `.fern/docs/api-reference` directory.

## Deployment üñ•Ô∏è

Merging to `main` will kick off an automatic deployment to production.
