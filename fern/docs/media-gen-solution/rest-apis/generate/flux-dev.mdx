Generate images using a FLUX.1 [Dev], a 12 billion parameter model using text descriptions. 
It excels in photorealism, processes complex prompts, and generates clear text.

OctoAI's FLUX.1 [Dev] API supports text-to-image use cases. 

You need to create an [OctoAI Authentication Token](getting-started/how-to-create-octoai-access-token) to access this API.

### **How to use**

Invoke `https://image.octoai.run/generate/flux-dev ` endpoint with a `POST` request.

The headers of the request must include an Authentication Token in the authorization field. The accept header should be set to `application/json` to receive the image encoded as base64 in a JSON response.

**Generating with a prompt**: Commonly referred to as **text-to-image**, this mode generates an image from text alone. While the only required
parameter is the `prompt`, it also supports a `width` and `height` parameter which can be used to control the aspect ratio of the generated image.


<Note>
    For more details about all parameters, please see the request schema below.
</Note>


### **Output**

The resolution of the generated image will be 1 megapixel. The default resolution is 1024x1024.

### **Pricing**

***$0.02*** per image, 30 steps, 1024X1024 

Check [Pricing Page](https://octo.ai/docs/getting-started/pricing-and-billing) for more details.

### **Request Details**

  **Headers**: 

    `Authorization` (Required): YourÂ `OCTOAI_TOKEN`  
    `Content-Type` (Required): Set to `application/json`

  **Parameters**: 

  - `prompt` (string [ 1 .. 10000 ] characters, Required): A string of text describing the image to generate. A strong, descriptive prompt that clearly defines elements, colors, and subjects will lead to better results.
  - `cfg_scale` (double, Optional): Floating-point number represeting how closely to adhere to prompt description. Must be a positive number no greater than 50.0. Recommended values between 4-6. 
  - `num_images` (integer, Optional): Integer representing how many output images to generate with a single prompt/configuration. Defaults to 1. Allowed values: 1-16.
  - `seed` (union, Optional): Integer number or list of integers representing the seeds of random generators. Fixing random seed is useful when attempting to generate a specific image. Must be greater than 0 and less than 2^32.
  - `steps` (integer, Optional Defaults to 30): Integer representing how many steps of diffusion to run. Must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 200.
  - `height` (integer, Optional): Integer representing the height of image to generate. Default to 1024. 
  - `width` (integer, Optional): Integer representing the width of image to generate. Default to 1024. 
  - `loras` (string,Optional): Here you can specify LoRAs, in name-weight pairs, either from the OctoAI asset library or your private asset library. 

  **Supported Output Resolutions (Width x Height)** are as follows:
