title: Stable Diffusion XL Lighting API
slug: media-gen-solution/rest-apis/generate/sdxl-lighting
---

Generate an image using a Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) Lighting model.

OctoAI's SDXL-Lightning model is a lightning-fast text-to-image generation model (checkpoint). It can generate high-quality 1024px images in a few steps (4-8 steps) within sub seconds.

Recommended values to get optimal results from SDXL lighting model are: 
    - Set steps between 4-8 steps (8 steps recommended) 
    - Keep CFG Scale low, ranging from 1.4 to 4.0 (ideally 3.0)
    - Use any sampler, textual inversion, or style preset.
    - Adding extra LoRAs and VAEs increases inference time.

You need to create an [OctoAI Authentication Token](getting-started/how-to-create-octoai-access-token) to access this API.

### **How to use**

Invoke `https://image.octoai.run/generate/sdxl` endpoint with a `POST` request.

The headers of the request must include an Authentication Token in the authorization field. The accept header should be set to `application/json` to receive the image encoded as base64 in a JSON response.

**Generating with a prompt**: Commonly referred to as **text-to-image**, this mode generates an image from text alone. While the only required
parameter is the `prompt`, it also supports a `width` and `height` parameter which can be used to control the aspect ratio of the generated image.

**Generating with a prompt**: Commonly referred to as **text-to-image**, this mode generates an image from text alone. The required parameters are:

  - `prompt` - text to generate the image from
  - `checkpoint` -  Here you can specify the SDXL Lighting checkpoint. Supported value `octoai:lightning_sdxl`

**Generating with a prompt and an image**: Commonly referred to as **image-to-image**, this mode also generates an image from text but uses an existing image as the starting point. The required parameters are:

  - `prompt` - text to generate the image from
  - `checkpoint` -  `octoai:lightning_sdxl`
  - `init_image` - the image to use as the starting point for the generation. Argument takes an image encoded as a string in base64 format.
  - `strength` - controls how much influence the image parameter has on the output image

**Generating with a prompt and a custom asset**: This mode generates an image from text but uses either a custom checkpoint, LoRA, textual inversion, or VAE. Note that using a custom asset increases generation time.

  - `prompt` - text to generate the image from
  - `checkpoint` -  `octoai:lightning_sdxl`
  - `loras` -  Here you can specify LoRAs, in name-weight pairs, either from the OctoAI asset library or your private asset library. 
  - `textual_inversions` - Here you can specify textual inversions and their corresponding trigger words. 
  - `vae` -  Here you can specify variational autoencoders. 

**Inpainting with a prompt**: Inpainting replaces or edits specific areas of an image. This makes it a useful tool for image restoration like removing defects and artifacts, or even replacing an image area with something entirely new. Inpainting relies on a mask to determine which regions of an image to fill in. The required parameters are:

  - `prompt` - text to generate the image from
  - `checkpoint` -  `octoai:lightning_sdxl`
  - `init_image` - the image to use as the starting point for the generation. Argument takes an image encoded as a string in base64 format.
  - `mask_image` -  area of the picture to inpaint. Argument takes an image encoded as a string in base64 format.

**Outpainting with a prompt**: Outpainting is the process of using an image generation model like Stable Diffusion to extend beyond the canvas of an existing image. Outpainting is very similar to inpainting, but instead of generating a region within an existing image, the model generates a region outside of it. The required parameters are:

  - `prompt` - text to generate the image from
  - `checkpoint` -  `octoai:lightning_sdxl`
  - `init_image` - the existing image you’d like to outpaint. You need to create a source image that places your original image within a larger canvas. Argument takes an image encoded as a string in base64 format.
  - `mask_image` - a black and white mask representing the extended area. Argument takes an image encoded as a string in base64 format.
  - `outpainting` -  Argument takes a boolean value to determine Whether the request requires outpainting or not. If so, special preprocessing is applied for better results. Defaults to `false`. This needs to be set to `true`, if you wish to use outpainting.

### **Request Details**

  **Headers**: 

    `Authorization` (Required): Your `OCTOAI_TOKEN`  
    `Content-Type` (Required): Set to `application/json`

  **Parameters**: 

    - `prompt` (string [ upto 77 tokens], Required): A string of text describing the image to generate. You can use prompt weighting, e.g. `(A tall (beautiful:1.5) woman:1.0) (some other prompt with weight:0.8)` . The weight will be the product of all brackets a token is a member of. The brackets, colons and weights do not count towards the number of tokens.
    - `negative_prompt` (string, Optional): Text describing image traits to avoid during generation.
    - `sampler` (string, Optional): A string specifying which scheduler to use when generating an image. Defaults to `DDIM`. Regular samplers include `DDIM`,`DDPM`,`DPM_PLUS_PLUS_2M_KARRAS`,`DPM_SINGLE`,`DPM_SOLVER_MULTISTEP`,`K_EULER`, `K_EULER_ANCESTRAL`,`PNDM`,`UNI_PC`.
