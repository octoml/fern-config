title: FLUX.1 [Schnell]
slug: media-gen-solution/rest-apis/generate/flux-schnell
---

Generate images using a FLUX.1 [schnell], a 12 billion parameter model using text descriptions. FLUX.1 [schnell] is openly available under an Apache2.0 license.
It excels in photorealism, processes complex prompts, and generates clear text.

OctoAI's FLUX.1 [Schnell] API supports **text-to-image**, **image-to-image**, and **inpainting** use cases. 

You need to create an [OctoAI Authentication Token](getting-started/how-to-create-octoai-access-token) to access this API.

### **How to use**

Invoke `https://image.octoai.run/generate/flux-schnell ` endpoint with a `POST` request.

The headers of the request must include an Authentication Token in the authorization field. The accept header should be set to `application/json` to receive the image encoded as base64 in a JSON response.

**Generating with a prompt**: Commonly referred to as **text-to-image**, this mode generates an image from text alone. While the only required
parameter is the `prompt`, it also supports a `width` and `height` parameter which can be used to control the aspect ratio of the generated image.

**Generating with a prompt and an image**: Commonly referred to as **image-to-image**, this mode also generates an image from text but uses an existing image as the starting point. The required parameters are:

  - `prompt` - text to generate the image from
  - `init_image` - the image to use as the starting point for the generation. Argument takes an image encoded as a string in base64 format.
  - `strength` - controls how much influence the image parameter has on the output image

**Inpainting with a prompt**: **Inpainting** replaces or edits specific areas of an image. This makes it a useful tool for image restoration like removing defects and artifacts, or even replacing an image area with something entirely new. Inpainting relies on a mask to determine which regions of an image to fill in. The required parameters are:

  - `prompt` - text to generate the image from
  - `init_image` - the image to use as the starting point for the generation. Argument takes an image encoded as a string in base64 format.
  - `mask_image` -  area of the picture to inpaint. Argument takes an image encoded as a string in base64 format.

### **Output**

The resolution of the generated image will be 1 megapixel. The default resolution is 1024x1024.

### **Pricing**

***$0.002*** per image, 4 steps, 1024X1024

### **Request Details**

  **Headers**: 

    `Authorization` (Required): YourÂ `OCTOAI_TOKEN`  
    `Content-Type` (Required): Set to `application/json`

  **Parameters**: 

  - `prompt` (string [ 1 .. 10000 ] characters, Required): A string of text describing the image to generate. A strong, descriptive prompt that clearly defines elements, colors, and subjects will lead to better results.
  - `cfg_scale` (double, Optional): Floating-point number represeting how closely to adhere to prompt description. Must be a positive number no greater than 50.0. Recommended values between 4-6. 
  - `num_images` (integer, Optional): Integer representing how many output images to generate with a single prompt/configuration. Defaults to 1. Allowed values: 1-16.
  - `seed` (union, Optional): Integer number or list of integers representing the seeds of random generators. Fixing random seed is useful when attempting to generate a specific image. Must be greater than 0 and less than 2^32.
  - `steps` (integer, Optional Defaults to 4): Integer representing how many steps of diffusion to run. Must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 200.
  - `height` (integer, Optional): Integer representing the height of image to generate. Default to 1024. 
  - `width` (integer, Optional): Integer representing the width of image to generate. Default to 1024. 
  - `loras` (string,Optional): Here you can specify LoRAs, in name-weight pairs, either from the OctoAI asset library or your private asset library. 
  - `init_image` (string, Optional): The image (encoded in b64 string) to use as the starting point for the generation. This parameter is for Image-to-Image generation and Inpainting. 
    <Note> Use .jpg format to ensure best latency </Note>
  - `strength` (double,Optional): Floating-point number indicating how much creative the Image-to-Image generation mode should be. Must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1.0. Defaults to 0.8. This parameter is for Image-to-Image generation. 
  - `mask_image` (string, Optional): Only applicable for inpainting use cases i.e. to specify which area of the picture to paint onto. Argument takes an image encoded as a string in base64 format.
    <Note> Use .jpg format to ensure best latency </Note>


  **Supported Output Resolutions (Width x Height)** are as follows:
