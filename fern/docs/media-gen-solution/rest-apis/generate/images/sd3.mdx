title: SD3 REST API
slug: media-gen-solution/rest-apis/Generate/Images

### 1. **Overview and Introduction (Stable Diffusion 3 API)

- **Purpose and Scope**: 
Generate an image using a Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3 Medium - the 2 billion parameter model).
It excels in photorealism, processes complex prompts, and generates clear text.

OctoAI's SD3 API supports both text-to-image and image-to-image use cases. 

- **Authentication**: You need to create an [OctoAI Authentication Token](getting-started/how-to-create-octoai-access-token) to access this API.

### 2. **Endpoint Structure**

### How to use

Invoke `https://image.octoai.run/generate/sd3` endpoint with a `POST` request.

The headers of the request must include an Authentication Token in the authorization field. The accept header should be set to `application/json` to receive the image encoded as base64 in a JSON response.

**Generating with a prompt**
Commonly referred to as **text-to-image**, this mode generates an image from text alone. While the only required
parameter is the `prompt`, it also supports a `width` and `height` parameter which can be used to control the aspect ratio of the generated image.

**Generating with a prompt and an image**
Commonly referred to as **image-to-image**, this mode also generates an image from text but uses an existing image as the starting point. The required parameters are:

`prompt` - text to generate the image from
`init_image` - the image to use as the starting point for the generation
`strength` - controls how much influence the image parameter has on the output image


Optional Parameters:

`image_encoding` - the the format of the output image
`seed` - the randomness seed to use for the generation
`negative_prompt` - keywords of what you do not wish to see in the output image

<Note>
    Note: for more details about these and additional parameters, please see the request schema below.
</Note>


### Output

The resolution of the generated image will be 1 megapixel. The default resolution is 1024x1024.

### 3. **Request Details**

- **Headers**: 
| Authorization | required | Your `OCTOAI_TOKEN` used to authenticate your requests. 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Content-Type | required | Always the value “application/json” |

- **Parameters**: 

- `prompt` (string [ 1 .. 10000 ] characters, Required): A string of text describing the image to generate. A strong, descriptive prompt that clearly defines elements, colors, and subjects will lead to better results.
- `negative_prompt` (string, Optional): Text describing image traits to avoid during generation.
- `cfg_scale (double, Optional): Floating-point number represeting how closely to adhere to prompt description. Must be a positive number no greater than 50.0. Defaults to 12.
- `image_encoding (enum, Optional): Define which encoding process should be applied before returning the generated image(s). Allowed values: `jpeg` `png`
- `num_images` (integer, Optional): Integer representing how many output images to generate with a single prompt/configuration. Defaults to 1. Allowed values: 1-16.
- `seed (union, Optional): Integer number or list of integers representing the seeds of random generators. Fixing random seed is useful when attempting to generate a specific image. Must be greater than 0 and less than 2^32.
- `steps (integer, Optional Defaults to 30): Integer representing how many steps of diffusion to run. Must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 200.
- `init_image (string, Optional): The image (encoded in b64 string) to use as the starting point for the generation. This parameter is for Image-to-Image generation. 
- `strength (double,Optional): Floating-point number indicating how much creative the Image to Image generation mode should be. Must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1.0. Defaults to 0.8. This parameter is for Image-to-Image generation. 
- `height (integer, Optional): Integer representing the height of image to generate. Default to 1024. 
- `width (integer, Optional): Integer representing the width of image to generate. Default to 1024. 

**Supported Output Resolutions (Width x Height)** are as follows:

SD3:
 
```(1536, 640), (768, 1344), (832, 1216), (1344, 768),
(1152, 896),(640, 1536), (1216, 832), (896, 1152), (1024, 1024)
```
