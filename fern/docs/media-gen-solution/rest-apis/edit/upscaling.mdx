Upscale your images to a higher resolution with the Upscaling API. Your input image can have a minimum resolution of 256x256 and a maximum resolution of 2048x2048, and can be upscaled to a maximum resolution of 8192x8192.                                                                                              

OctoAI's Upscaling API supports models `real-esrgan-x4-plus` ,`real-esrgan-x4-v3`, `real-esrgan-x4-v3-wdn`, `real-esrgan-animevideo-v3`, `real-esrgan-x4-plus-anime` ,`real-esrgan-x2-plus`

You need to create an [OctoAI Authentication Token](getting-started/how-to-create-octoai-access-token) to access this API.

### **How to use**

Invoke `https://image.octoai.run/upscaling` endpoint with a `POST` request.

The headers of the request must include an Authentication Token in the authorization field. The accept header should be set to `application/json` to receive the image encoded as base64 in a JSON response.

Required parameters are:
  - `init_image` (string, required):  base64-encoded image to upscale. 
  - `init_image_url` (string, required if init_image not provided): The URL to an image to upscale.
  - `scale` (float,required): Factor by which to scale the input resolution by (e.g., `scale: 2.0` would double the input width and height)  
  - `output_image_height` (integer, required if scale not provided): height of the desired upscaled image in pixels. The corresponding width will be computed off of this value to preserve the aspect ratio.  
  - `output_image_width` (integer, required if scale not provided): width of the desired upscaled image in pixels. The corresponding height will be computed off of this value to preserve the aspect ratio.

<Note>
    For more details about all parameters, please see the request schema below.

### **Output**

Upscaled image. Max support resolution 8192X8192.

### **Pricing**
