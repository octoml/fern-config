### API

Upscaling takes an existing image you provide and upscales it to a higher resolution.

Parameters:

* `init_image_url` / `init_image` \- The URL to an image or a base64-encoded image (respectively) to upscale. Specify only one of these.
* `scale` / `output_image_height` / `output_image_width` \- determined how much to upscale the provided image. Specify only one of these.  
   * `scale` \- floating point value indicating how much to scale the input resolution by (e.g., `scale: 2.0` would double the input width and height)  
   * `output_image_height` \- height of the desired upscaled image in pixels. The corresponding width will be computed off of this value to preserve the aspect ratio.  
   * `output_image_width` \- width of the desired upscaled image in pixels. The corresponding height will be computed off of this value to preserve the aspect ratio.
* `model` (optional): The model to use for upscaling faces. Default value is `real-esrgan-x4-plus`. Options:  
   * `real-esrgan-x4-plus`  
   * `real-esrgan-x4-v3`  
   * `real-esrgan-x4-v3-wdn`  
   * `real-esrgan-animevideo-v3`  
   * `real-esrgan-x4-plus-anime`  
   * `real-esrgan-x2-plus`
