Rate limits are restrictions applied by OctoAI on the rate at which an individual account can submit inference requests against an API endpoint. It is a mechanism used to ensure predictable performance of the platform, and to allow all OctoAI customers to experience predictable inference latencies. Inference requests that are not completed because of a rate limit cap will return an HTTP 429 response code, and can be retried after an appropriate backoff period.
