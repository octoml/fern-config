title: Multi-user accounts
subtitle: >-
  The default setup is 1 user profile per 1 OctoAI account. We can easily help
  you setup multiple users within a single account if you have a team or
  organization with multiple users. This will allow your team to manage
  endpoints, view logs & metrics, and securely share access to the account.
