Add some sample text here. 

We built a full image generation web application that allows users to upload any portrait and get a cartoonized version of the portrait back! This application uses optimized Stable Diffusion and CLIP endpoints hosted on OctoAI for the backend, along with Streamlit for the frontend.

The full code and walkthrough can be found in this [Github repo](https://github.com/octoml/octoai-template-apps/tree/main/cartoonizer).
