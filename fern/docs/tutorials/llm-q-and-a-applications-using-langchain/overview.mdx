## Overview

To make it easier for you to build apps using OctoAI's LLM endpoints, we built end-to-end examples on GitHub [here](https://github.com/octoml/hackathon-2023-rag/tree/main/web-retreiver) and [here](https://github.com/octoml/hackathon-2023-rag/tree/main/pdf-qa) that you can clone and edit.

- The example apps use 🦜️🔗langchain, 🦙llama_index, and an OctoAI-hosted LLM endpoint to implement [(1) ](environment-setup)a generic chatbot and an interface that answers questions about a specific PDF document, and [(2)](../building-a-movie-chatbot-app/prerequisites-and-steps-to-build-movie-chatbot-app) a side-by-side chatbot that shows responses from two OctoAI endpoint models using augmented retrieval from OctoAI Documentation and Kubernetes Documentation.
