## Introduction

BotDojo is a low-code platform that harmonizes design, testing, and observability, enabling a more integrated and powerful AI-first development environment. 
With BotDojo, you can rapidly prototype, test, and iterate on your AI applications, and deploy them with confidence.

## Using OctoAI and BotDojo

The OctoAI integration with BotDojo enables you to build and deploy AI applications using Large Language Models, with the confidence of tested 
and reliable performance within a comfortable low-code environment.

You can use BotDojo's robust tools to design, test, and deploy your AI applications, already integrated with OctoAI's Text and Embedding endpoints.
