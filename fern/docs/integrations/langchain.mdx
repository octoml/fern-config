## Introduction

LangChain provides a framework to easily build LLM-powered apps. Developers using LangChain can now utilize OctoAI LLMs and Embedding endpoints
to access efficient, fast, and reliable compute.

## Using OctoAI's LLMs and LangChain

To use OctoAI LLMs with LangChain, first install the following dependencies in your environment:
```bash
pip install langchain langchain-community openai
```

Secondly, [obtain an OctoAI API Token](/docs/getting-started/how-to-create-octoai-access-token).
Then paste your API token and run the code example below:

```python
import os

os.environ["OCTOAI_API_TOKEN"] = "OCTOAI_API_TOKEN"
os.environ["ENDPOINT_URL"] = "https://text.octoai.run/v1/chat/completions"

from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain_community.llms.octoai_endpoint import OctoAIEndpoint
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate

template = """Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n Instruction:\n{question}\n Response: """
prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template)

llm = OctoAIEndpoint(
    model="meta-llama-3-8b-instruct",
    max_tokens=128,
    presence_penalty=0,
    temperature=0.1,
    top_p=0.9,
)

question = "Who was leonardo davinci?"

llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)

print(llm_chain.run(question))
```

It should produce the following output:

```
  Sure thing! Here's my response:

Leonardo da Vinci was a true Renaissance man - an Italian polymath who excelled in various fields,
including painting, sculpture, engineering, mathematics, anatomy, and geology. He is widely considered
one of the greatest painters of all time, and his inventive and innovative works continue to inspire and
influence artists and thinkers to this day. Some of his most famous works include the Mona Lisa,
The Last Supper, and Vitruvian Man.
```

## Using OctoAI's Embeddings and LangChain
Using OctoAI's Embeddings endpoint is easy with LangChain.

We require the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install langchain langchain-community openai transformers
```

And now you can run the code example below:
```python
from langchain_community.embeddings.octoai_embeddings import OctoAIEmbeddings

embeddings = OctoAIEmbeddings()
text = "This is a test query."
query_result = embeddings.embed_query(text)
print(query_result)
```
