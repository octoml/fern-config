title: Image Generator Python client
slug: python-sdk/image-generator-client
---

The `ImageGenClient` class specializes in supporting image generation in your application, and guiding what options are available to modify your outputs. It will return a list of all images using the `ImageGeneration` type. It allows you to use Stable Diffusion XL for text to image and image to image use cases, and set parameters and prompts either with weighted prompts with the `prompt` field or human-readable descriptions using `prompt_2`.

This guide will walk you through a text to image example, and then we will use the resulting image to demonstrate the image to image use case.

#### Requirements

- First, [create an OctoAI API token.](/docs/getting-started/how-to-create-octoai-access-token)
- Then, complete [Python SDK Installation & Setup.](installation-and-setup).
  - If you use the `OCTOAI_TOKEN` envvar for your token, you can instantiate the image_gen client with `client = OctoAI().image_gen`

#### Simple Text to Image Generation Example

```Python Python
from octoai.util import to_file
from octoai.client import OctoAI

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # If OCTOAI_TOKEN is not set as an envvar, you can also pass a token to the client with:
    # ImageGenerator(token="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE")
    client = OctoAI()
    # images is a list of Images from octoai.types
    image_resp = client.image_gen.generate_sdxl(
        prompt="photorealistic, poodle, intricately detailed"
    )
    images = image_resp.images

    # images can be filtered for safety, so since we only generated 1 image by default, this verifies
    # we actually have an image to show.
    if not images[0].removed_for_safety:
        to_file(images[0], "output.jpg")
```

After running this simple prompt, you should hopefully have an output somewhat similar to the image below:

![astropus.png](https://www.datocms-assets.com/45680/1703719748-pretty-colorful-poodle.jpeg?max-w=2000&auto=compress)

A good start and in our next example, we'll use more features to help guide our outputs.

#### Text to Image Generation Example

One of the simplest ways to customize your outputs is a `style_preset`, `negative_prompt`, `loras`, and through image generation model selection.

```Python Python
from octoai.util import to_file
from octoai.client import OctoAI

if __name__ == "__main__":
    client = OctoAI()

    prompt = "photorealistic, colorful, poodle, intricately detailed"
    file_name = "pretty_poodle_cinematic.jpeg"

    images_resp = client.image_gen.generate_sdxl(
        prompt=prompt,
        negative_prompt="horror, scary, low-quality, extra limbs, cartoon",
        checkpoint="crystal-clear",
        style_preset="cinematic",
        loras={"add-detail": 1.0},
        steps=50,
    )
    images = images_resp.images
    # It can also be helpful to run another generate method with
    # num_images = image_resp.removed_for_safety to get your desired total images
    if not images[0].removed_for_safety:
        to_file(images[0], file_name)

```

Much more realistic! Now that we have our cinematic poodle, let's go ahead and use this image as part of an image-to-image workflow.

#### Image to Image Generation Example

Image to Image Generation lets you use a base image, in our case the above `pretty_poodle.jpeg` to shape the feel of your outputs image. In our case, we'd expect some focal point in the center, and a blurred, bright background, but otherwise our output can look anywhere from completely different or quite similar depending on our prompt. In this case, let's go for a complete different style of outputs and stray from the usual theme of poodles to a corgi in the rain.

```Python Python
from octoai.util import to_file, from_file
from octoai.client import OctoAI

if __name__ == "__main__":
    client = OctoAI()

    init = from_file("pretty_poodle_cinematic.jpeg")
    images_resp = client.image_gen.generate_sdxl(
        prompt="corgi in the rain",
        init_image=init,  # Only used for image-to-image
        strength=0.8,  # Only used for image-to-image
        style_preset="anime"
    )
    images = images_resp.images

    to_file(images[0], "rain_corgi.jpeg")
```
